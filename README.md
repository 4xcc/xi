xcc's installation helper for arch linux XSM (personal installation guide).

This guide uses an overview file called 'o' to keep a list
of instructions for installing arch linux the xcc way.  When
a bullet point is a short description of the step,
additional information can be found on the step in a file
with the same name.  When a bullet point is in itself a
command, input the command with any parameters or values
adjusted to the context of the installation.  When there's a
tack (-) in front of a step, it indicates that it's a
branch. Pick the appropriate step and cat out more
information under the file with the same name if neccessary.

to get started:

`git clone https://github.com/vsaya/xi.git`

and

`cat xi/o`
